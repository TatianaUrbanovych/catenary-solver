# Catenary Solver

## Overview
Catenary Solver is a React-based web application designed to solve and visualize catenary curves. This project allows users to input parameters and see the resulting catenary shape, providing insights into the mathematical properties of catenaries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CatenarySolver
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate an optimized build in the `build` directory.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can input the parameters for the catenary curve, and the application will display the resulting curve based on the mathematical equations governing catenaries.
